Test first website
# HTML Resume Website

This is a simple resume website created as part of a beginner HTML/CSS task during my IT course at Women IT Academy in 2024.

The assignment goal was to:
- Create a single HTML page
- Structure it using semantic tags
- Present personal information clearly (resume format)

## ✨ What I added beyond the task:

- Improved layout and styling with CSS
- Section for skills and tools I use
- Contact information and links
- Responsive structure for better display

## 💡 Purpose:

This site was created to practice basic frontend development and understand how to build and structure a simple website manually without any framework.
