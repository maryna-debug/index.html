Test first website

# HTML Practice Website – Fun Project

This is a simple HTML/CSS website I created as a training assignment during my IT course.  
Instead of a typical resume, I made a fun and creative site about my dog.

The goal was to:
- Practice HTML/CSS structure
- Use semantic tags
- Create a personal site layout

I also added:
- My dog’s Instagram 😄
- Photo and short description
